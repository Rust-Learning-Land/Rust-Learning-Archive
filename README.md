# rust-learning [Credits](https://github.com/ctjhoa/rust-learning)

A bunch of links to blog posts, articles, videos, etc for learning Rust. Feel free to submit a pull request if you have some links/resources to add. Also, I try to verify that the articles below have some real content (i.e. they aren't 2 paragraph long blog posts with little information) to ensure I'm not listing "fluff" pieces. If you have an idea for a better way to organize these links, please let me know.

## Introduction

*Do you want to be convinced that Rust is worth learning?* Let us show you the [True Nature of the Force](https://brson.github.io/fireflowers/).

The main documentation is always the best beginning, so if you haven't read it yet, start by reading the [Rust docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/documentation.html). You can also have the ebook versions of the doc [here](http://killercup.github.io/trpl-ebook/) and [here](https://github.com/lise-henry/books/).

### Tag meanings

* :star: Something made by a rust team member.
* :end: Concepts are still useful but code could not compile.
* :soon: Work In Progress.

### [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) *Free*

Welcome! This book will teach you about the Rust programming language. Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a garbage collector, making it a useful language for several use cases other languages arenât good at: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems. It improves on current languages targeting this space by having several compile-time safety checks that produce no runtime overhead while eliminating all data races. Rust also aims to achieve âzero-cost abstractionsâ even though some of these abstractions feel like those of a high-level language. Even then, Rust still allows precise control like a low-level language would.

### [Welcome to Rust-101](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/main.html) *Free*

This is Rust-101, a small tutorial for the Rust language. It is intended to be an interactive, hands-on course: I believe the only way to really learn a language is to write code in it, so you should be coding during the course.
If you have any questions that are not answered here, check out the "Additional Resources" below. In particular, the IRC channel is filled with awesome people willing to help you! I spent lots of time there ;-)
I will assume some familiarity with programming, and hence not explain the basic concepts common to most languages. Instead, I will focus on what makes Rust special.

### [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) *Free*

Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries. To get even more out of these examples, don't forget to [install Rust locally](http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) and check out the [official docs](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/). Additionally for the curious, you can also [check out the source code for this site](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example).

### [Easy Rust](https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/) *Free*

Rust is a new language that already has good textbooks. But sometimes its textbooks are difficult because they are for native English speakers. Many companies and people now learn Rust, and they could learn faster with a book that has easy English. This textbook is for these companies and people to learn Rust with simple English.

### [Why Rust?](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/why-rust.csp)

<img src="http://covers.oreillystatic.com/images/0636920040446/cat.gif" width="120px"/>

While systems programming languages have greatly evolved since the introduction of C more than 40 years ago, our capacity for dumb mistakes with enormous consequences has remained unchanged, with vivid examples regularly in the news. This O'Reilly report examines Rust, a new systems programming language that combines safety and security with performance on a par with C and C++.

### [Learning Rust](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Rust-comprehensive-writing-applications/dp/1785884301)

<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41RBJ0J9WOL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="120px"/>

Rust is a highly concurrent and high-performance language that focuses on safety and speed, memory management, and writing clean code.

<img src="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-1-4842-3468-6" width="120px"/>

Learn to program with Rust in an easy, step-by-step manner on Unix, Linux shell, macOS and the Windows command line.  As you read this book, youâll build on the knowledge you gained in previous chapters and see what Rust has to offer.  

Beginning Rust starts with the basics of Rust, including how to name objects, control execution flow, and handle primitive types. Youâll see how to do arithmetic, allocate memory, use iterators, and handle input/output. Once you have mastered these core skills, youâll work on handling errors and using the object-oriented features of Rust to build robust Rust applications in no time.

Only basic knowledge of programming is required, preferably in C or C++. To understand this book, it's enough to know what integers and floating-point numbers are, and to distinguish identifiers from string literals.

This book is divided into three main parts that will take you on an exciting journey of building a fully functional web server. The book starts with a solid introduction to Rust and essential networking concepts. This will lay a foundation for, and set the tone of, the entire book. In the second part, we will take an in-depth look at using Rust for networking software. From client-server networking using sockets to IPv4/v6, DNS, TCP, UDP, you will also learn about serializing and deserializing data using serde. The book shows how to communicate with REST servers over HTTP. The final part of the book discusses asynchronous network programming using the Tokio stack. Given the importance of security for modern systems, you will see how Rust supports common primitives such as TLS and public-key cryptography.

<img src="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/PPrustS.png" width="120px"/>

Rust is a statically and strongly typed systems programming language. statically means that all types are known at compile-time, strongly means that these types are designed to make it harder to write incorrect programs. A successful compilation means you have a much better guarantee of correctness than with a cowboy language like C. systems means generating the best possible machine code with full control of memory use. So the uses are pretty hardcore: operating systems, device drivers and embedded systems that might not even have an operating system. However, it's a very pleasant language to write normal application code in as well.

The big difference from C and C++ is that Rust is safe by default; all memory accesses are checked. It is not possible to corrupt memory by accident.

Very precisely, topics such as ownership, borrowing, structs, enums, and other collections are covered. Error handling, memory management, and concurrency are well-demonstrated using practical projects. The book explains how to construct automated tests, write multithreaded applications, and utilise common data structures without difficulty. The book concludes with several hands-on projects, including creating a CLI application, a web app, a binary image classifier, and an embedded programme.

You'll learn:

1) Learn Rust's Cargo, fundamental concepts, collections, generic data types, iterators, and closures.
